                            The death toll was at least seven on Thursday afternoon, and the authorities warned that the number could rise 
                            as communications improved. Prime Minister Édouard Philippe of France said that four people were confirmed dead 
                            on the Caribbean island of St. Martin, lowering a previous toll of eight deaths given by local rescue officials.

                            Irma “will bring life-threatening wind, storm surge and rainfall hazards” to the northern coast of Hispaniola, 
                            which includes the Dominican Republic and Haiti, on Thursday, the Hurricane Center warned. It will pass directly 
                            over — or very near — the low-lying islands of Turks and Caicos, a British possession, and parts of the Bahamas 
                            on Thursday and Friday, the center forecast, and push a storm surge of seawater 15 to 20 feet high. The surge 
                            could put large parts of the islands under water.

                 Hurricane Irma, a Category 5 storm with winds of up to 175 miles an hour, continued to tear through the Caribbean 
                 on Thursday, leaving devastation in its wake and prompting evacuation orders across the region.

                    A St. Martin official said on Wednesday night that “95 percent of the island is destroyed.”
